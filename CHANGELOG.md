# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [1.0.3] - 2026-02-19

### Fixed
- **ERR on rate limit (429)** — widget now keeps the last good data when the API returns 429 and backs off for 10 minutes before retrying, instead of wiping the display to ERR
- **ERR on transient failures** — any failed poll that returns no data is silently skipped if previous good data exists; ERR only shows when there has never been a successful fetch

---

## [1.0.2] - 2026-02-19

### Fixed
- **ERR on startup / after idle** — widget now re-reads `~/.claude/.credentials.json` on every poll cycle so a token refreshed by Claude Code overnight is picked up automatically, instead of staying stuck on the expired token loaded at startup

---

## [1.0.1] - 2026-02-19

### Fixed
- **Weekly reset timer** now shows days correctly (e.g. `4d 23h` instead of `119h 0m`)
- **Poll thread** wrapped in exception handler so a transient error no longer silently kills background refresh
- **Extra usage** (pay-as-you-go credits) was present in the API response but never displayed — it now appears in both the tray menu and the "Show Details" window

### Added
- **Extra Usage section** in the detail popup: shows monthly credit utilization with a colour-coded percentage and `used / limit` credits breakdown
- **Extra credits menu item**: displayed in the tray menu when extra usage is enabled on the account

---
